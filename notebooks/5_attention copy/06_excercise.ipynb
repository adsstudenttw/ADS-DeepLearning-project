The eye state was detected via a camera during the EEG measurement and added later manually to the file after analysing the video frames. '1' indicates the eye-closed and '0' the eye-open state. All values are in chronological order with the first measured value at the top of the data."

    "- build a custom Dataset that yields a $X, y$ tuple of tensors. $X$ should be sequential in time. Remember: a dataset should implement `__get_item__` and `__len__`.\n",
    "- You can try to implement your own datafactory. Study all the examples in `mads_datasets` sourcecode.\n",
    "- note that you could model this as both a classification task, but also as a sequence-to-sequence task! For this excercise, make it a classification task with consecutive 0s or 1s only.\n",
    "- Note that, for a training task, a seq2seq model will probably be more realistic. However, the classification is a nice excercise because it is harder to set up.\n",
    "- figure out what the length distribution is of your dataset: how many timestamps do you have for every consecutive sequence of 0s and 1s? On average, median, min, max?\n",

    "    2. yielding windowed and padded is medium level \n",
    "    3. yielding windowed, padded and batched is expert level, because the windowing will cause the timeseries to have different sizes. You will need to buffer before you can yield a batch.\n",
